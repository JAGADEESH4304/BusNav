Bus Route Planner 🚍
Overview
The Bus Route Planner is a web-based application that helps users find the best bus routes between a given source and destination. It calculates the shortest travel time or cheapest fare using Dijkstra’s algorithm.

Features
✅ Find Optimal Bus Routes – Based on time or cost preferences
✅ Graph-Based Pathfinding – Uses Dijkstra’s algorithm
✅ Interactive Web UI – Simple and easy-to-use interface
✅ Real-Time Input Handling – Users can enter any source and destination
✅ Efficient and Scalable – Built for accurate and fast computations

Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Python (Flask)
Algorithm: Dijkstra’s Algorithm
Data Storage: Text files or databases for route details
