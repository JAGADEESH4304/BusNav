# Bus-Route-Planner

## Overview

The **Bus-Route-Planner** is a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) project that determines the optimal route to a specified destination using graphs and heaps. Users provide the source and destination, and the program calculates the most efficient path based on time and distance.

## Features

- **Optimal Path Calculation:** Utilizes graph and heap data structures to find the shortest path between the source and destination.
- **Customizable Input:** Users can specify their starting point and destination to receive tailored route information.

## Data Files

- **BUS.TXT:** Contains bus route information.
- **EdgeWeight.txt:** Stores the weights (e.g., distances or times) between connected nodes in the graph.

## Implementation

The project is implemented in Python and includes the following modules:

- **Graph.py:** Manages the graph data structure and related algorithms.
- **MinHeap.py:** Implements the min-heap data structure to support efficient pathfinding operations.

## Usage

1. **Prepare Data Files:** Ensure that `BUS.TXT` and `EdgeWeight.txt` are populated with accurate and up-to-date information about bus routes and edge weights.
2. **Run the Program:** Execute the main script and input your source and destination when prompted.
3. **Receive Optimal Route:** The program will output the most efficient path based on the provided data.
